Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things

- This was an opportunity to learn the Spring Boot framework

- We had a taste of what it means to work on a real project, with deadlines and changes

- We learned new and more rigorous ways of testing the written code for error-free results

# Worst things

- We did not have the possibility to work on the application we had in mind because we had to follow an official requirements document

- Sometimes, we had to deal with ambiguity in the requirements document (but we learned that some level of ambiguity is inevitable)

- We did not have opportunity to change the frontend of the application

# Suggestions 

- A brief introduction to the Spring Boot framework before the start of the project; we felt a bit lost at the beginning
