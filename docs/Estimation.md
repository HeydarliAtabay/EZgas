# Estimation approach

First we consider an estimate by product decomposition, then an estimate by activity decomposition.

|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |              10                 |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |                150            | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1500|
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                              150        |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |4500 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    Approx. 1 week                |
